# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project is designed to predict breast cancer based on diagnostic features extracted from a breast mass. It uses machine learning algorithms to classify tumors as benign or malignant. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è
This is a POC(Proof of concept) kind-of project. The data used here comes up with no guarantee from the creator. So, don't use it for making farming decisions. If you do so, the creator is not responsible for anything. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use DEVELOPMENT into precision farming if developed at large scale and with authentic and verified data.

## Introduction
Breast cancer is a prevalent and life-threatening disease. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to assist in breast cancer diagnosis by predicting tumor malignancy from diagnostic features.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/boahan/CancerPrediction.git

Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train models and make predictions.


## Dataset
The breast cancer dataset used in this project is the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, which is available in data/data.csv. This dataset contains various features used for breast cancer diagnosis.

## Algorithms

1.Linear Regression
2.Decision Tree
3.Random Forest
